# Pong

This is a website implementation of Pong, prompted by a coding interview with Celtra. This two-player iteration is built for both mobile and desktop devices, with no external frameworks or libraries.

## How to Play

Balls will be rapidly thrown into the table. If a ball reaches the wall behind a player's paddle, the opposing player receives a point.

The paddles may be controlled using a touch screen device, a mouse, or the W-S and Up-Down keys.
